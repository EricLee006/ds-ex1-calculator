Program for data structure experiment.
Tested under g++ (4.8.1) and clang (sorry for forgetting the version...).
Usage: g++ -std=c++11 calculator.cpp -o calculator.exe
*-std=c++11 is an importent switch.
*It will generate some warnings, please ignore it.
I haven't use any IDE, so there is no other files, please compile by yourself.
